# Adaptive-Finite-Difference-Method---Diffusion-Equation
An adaptive finite difference method solver of the diffusion equation in 2D using DUNE.


To be able to use the code please first install DUNE:
<a href=https://gitlab.maths.lu.se/dune/installdune#installdune> How to install DUNE </a>

A detailed explanation of the theory can be read in the author's thesis paper:
<a href=http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9178881> Adaptive Finite Difference Methods and Implementation in the Software DUNE. </a>

The code is already implemented in the file "Example.py". Make sure to import the class in the file "PoissonSolverwT.py" first. The user can change the right-hand side function as desired and set the built-in refinement conditions. NOTE! To be able to run the code, you need to first activate the DUNE environment.
